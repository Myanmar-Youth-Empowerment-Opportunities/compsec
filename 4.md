# Attacker Goals

According to the answers I received from my MYEO tech team quiz, people most commonly understand that an attacker may wish to steal data.
But as discussed in the last lesson, different attackers may have different motivations, which in tern means that
they may have different goals, which might be broader than just stealing information: 


## information disclosure

This is the one which you already seem to know. The attacker may seek information out of the system.
Some attackers may want the secret for themselves, but note others may wish to publish it for everyone to see.

## theft

Computers and networks don't just exist in abstract cyber land! Computer equipment is valuable, and someone
may wish to steal it, either for themselves, or to sell. Physical security is a part of computer security.

## physical damage

Sometimes, an attacker doesn't care to take anything, so long as the defender no longer has it.
This can be acheived by physically destroying the equipment.

## data damage

Instead of destroying the physical equipment, an attacker may seek to destroy the electronic data.
This could be on a broadscale -- delete the entire database.
Or on a very targeted scale -- delete a single username from the database.
The attacker could also seek to change, rather than delete a record -- for example, change themselves to "full member" without paying.
The attacker could also seek to "poison" the data, that is, rather than delete data, make it useless by adding so many incorrect records, that no one knows which data is real of fake.

## disruption

Sometimes, as far as the atacker is concerned, the system is allowed to exist in general, but some of its
functionality must simply taken offline for a short period of time.

For example, an attacker may wish to prevent people from attending a certain concert.
They don't need to destroy the ticketing website, they just need to make it difficult or impossible to use, until after the date of the concert.

## misdirection

The attacker may not wish to go to the trouble of fully taking over the defenders equipment,
if they can leave it mostly as it already is, but convince the system to server the attackers goals.

An example is, serving spam to all the users on the network.
Another example is, running a bitcoin miner on the defenders server.


# Combined attacks and sub goals

If you manage to find an attacker working according to one of the above goals, you cannot assume that that is the only thing that they are trying to do.
Many attacks are only conducted as one stage of a much broader attack.

For example, a "theft" attack, may in turn lead to an easier "data disclosure" attack, since the attacker now has physical access to the equipment.

Or, or "data disclosure" attack may in turn lead to a "data damage" attack, as the attacker has gained a better understanding of how the system is put together, and thus may be able to come up with better ideas for "data damage" attacks.
