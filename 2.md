# Some Terminology

## Attacker

In computer security we speak of a system "being attacked", and thus, the general purpose name for the actor who is doing the attacking is "attacker".
This is probably the word that we will use the most

## Cracker

The word "cracker" is sometimes also used. It means "someone who breaks (into) computer systems". Most commonly, it has a malicious connotation -- i.e. a cracker breaks comptuer systems without the permission of the owners.

## Hacker

Most people are familiar with the usage of the word "hacker" to also mean someone who breaks into computer systems.
But, this usage comes from hollywood movies, it is not used much amongst people in the security industry.
We will also not use the word in that way in this course.

Amongst computer programmers "hacker" has positive, not negative connotation -- it means someone who is skillful at using systems in a way that they where not originally designed to be used.
For example a "cooking hacker" might be someone who is really good at combining flavours in strange or unusual ways.
A "hardware hacker" just means a (good quality) electronic engineer. An in general just a "hacker" probably refers to a really good computer programmer.

But, even this "good" defintion of hacker is still heavily associated with the "cracking" or "attacking" community, because the word itself developped out of cracking commnities in the US around the 1980s.

Some people get a bit angry about the different between hacker and cracker, beleiving strongly that only one term is correct. That's one reason why I'll mostly say "attacker" to be safe.

## Security Hacker

Even taking the "good" or "positive" meaning of hacker, we can correctly use "security hacker" to refer to someone who is highly skilled at messing with the security of systems.

## L33T

A way of spelling "elite". A l33t h4x0r describes the most skilled, i.e. most elite hackers. Sometimes people use the term seriously, but othertimes, they use it ironically, making fun of the silly spelling. The way of spelling things by replacing vowels with numbers is called l33t sp34k. It's pretty lame.

## Script Kiddie

A script kiddie (sometimes shortened to sk1dd13) is the opposite of l33t. They are someone who wants to attack systems, but knows something about the subject, so, they have to relly on other peoples pre-built "scripts" or "exploits" to do the work for them.

## Colourful hats

A "blackhat" or "black hat hacker" or "black hat cracker" is someone who breaks into computer systems for immoral or illegal reasons.
A "whitehat" is someone that knows how to attack systems, but only does so with the owners permission (e.g. to test the security), or for otherwise good reasons.
A "grayhat" is someone who is inbetween. For example, they may otherpeoples attack systems, but rather than taking advantage of the system for themselves, offer to fix the problem, for a fee.

We won't use these words much, because whether someone is white or blackhat depends on your idea of morality, and this is not an ethics course.
