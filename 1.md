# Computer Security

Computer Security (also called cyber security) is about protecting computer systems and networks.

This website is a course to teach you about it, not to an expert level, but to a higher level than the mandatory level taught in the MYEO handbook.

We will talk about concrete steps to protect yourself, and to protect MYEO, as well as more generally about how it works. As defence is impossible without understanding attack, we will also consider some ways of breaking systems.

# How to use

Please advance through the lessons one at a time using the "next" links. 

As the author does not have the free time to teach everything from scratch, and in any case many wonderful resources already exist, please be prepared that many of the "lessons" might actually just say "go and read such and such book". 

Some of the "lessons" may actually be quizes. Some of them may actually be practical exercises that you will be expected to do.

As the lessons are given in a specific order, please do not advance through them until you have understood the lesson, read the book, or completed the quiz or exercise.

For the quizes, I will try to enable automatic grading if possible. I might read your quiz responses, or I might not, so don't wait around for me to grade them before progressing. The point of the quizes is to get you thinking about the topic, not for me to check up on you.

But do feel free to contact the author directly if you have any questions or comments.
