# Computer Security

Computer Security (also called cyber security) is about protecting computer systems and networks.

This website is a course to teach you about it, not to an expert level, but to a higher level than the mandatory level taught in the MYEO handbook.

We will talk about concrete steps to protect yourself, and to protect MYEO, as well as more generally about how it works. As defence is impossible without understanding attack, we will also consider some ways of breaking systems.
