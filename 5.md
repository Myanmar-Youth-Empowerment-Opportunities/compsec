# Attacks and Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability

A "vulnerability" is a weakness or oversight in a computer system, which allows it to be exploited by an attacker.

A vulnerability might occur due to a computer programming error, but also it could be due to an error in setting the system up, or an error of the systems users.

# Vulnerable

A system, or part of a system is "vulnerable" if it contains at least one vulnerability.

## Attack surface

Parts of a computer system which are available, visible, or accesible to an attacker are called the attack surface.
The term "attack surface" may also be especially used to refer to the parts of the system that are vulnerable.

## Attack

"Attack" as a noun, refers to specific types of attacks that an attacker may use. You might say, for example "she performed a phishing attack yesterday".

## Exploit

An exploit is a script, program, or set of instructions about how an exploit may be exploited. They are often created by l33t h4x0rs, and then sold or published for free for re-use by skiddies.
