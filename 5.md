# Attacks and Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability

A "vulnerability" is a weakness or oversight in a computer system, which allows it to be exploited by an attacker.

A vulnerability might occur due to a computer programming error, but also it could be due to an error in setting the system up, or an error of the systems users.


## Vulnerable

A system, or part of a system is "vulnerable" if it contains at least one vulnerability.

## zero-day

A 0-day is a vulnerability which is unknown to the vendor or owner of a computer system. For example, a computer system has a weak password, but the owner does not realise.

The strange name comes from a previous definition, where the 0 referred to number of days since a softwares release. So a program with a zero-day meant a program that was "hacked" even before it was published.

But these days, the term "zero day" refers to anything which is vulnerable, without the owner or vendors knowledge, regardless of the release date.

## CVE

"Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures" is a database of publically known vulnerabilities. Security researchers when disovering a vulnerability may request a "CVE number", and place the vulnerability of the database.

Of course the database cannot be complete, since many vulnerabilities are unknown, and many are intentionally kept secret.

You can search the database here: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi


## Attack surface

Parts of a computer system which are available, visible, or accesible to an attacker are called the attack surface.
The term "attack surface" may also be especially used to refer to the parts of the system that are vulnerable.

## Attack

"Attack" as a noun, refers to specific types of attacks that an attacker may use. You might say, for example "she performed a phishing attack yesterday".

## Exploit

An exploit is a script, program, or set of instructions about how an exploit may be exploited. They are often created by l33t h4x0rs, and then sold or published for free for re-use by skiddies.

## Patch

A "patch" refers to changes or revisions made to software. In computer security we are specifically interested in "security patches" which are changes made to software in order to remove a vulnerability.

## Window of vulnerability

Consider the following timeline:

1. A vulnerability is discovered in some software
2. the vulnerability is either reported to the vendor, or indepdently discovered by the vendor
3. A security patch is published by the vendor
4. Attackers, perceiving that the patch exists, learn how to exploit the vulnerability
5. most or all systems have applied the patch (i.e., updated their software)

The "window of vulnerability" refers to the timeframe through which the vulnerability is active.
If the person who discovered the vulnerability in step 1 is a blackhat, then, they may start exploiting it immediately, and in that case, the window of vulnerability starts at the time of step 1.
On the other hand, if the person who discovers the vulnerability is a whitehat, they will report it to the vendor without using it. Although the vulnerability was already pre-existing, the window of vulnerability will not start until step 4. Step 4 exists because, if a security patch exists, it means that a vulnerability must also have existed, so blackhats study security patches and will usually quickly discover what the underlying vulnerability to be fixed was.
The window of vulnerability exists because even after the seurity patch is published, not everyone will install it. Often, blackhats will be faster at discovering that the vulnerability exists, than users will be in updating, and thus, they have a window of time in which the attack is still viable.
