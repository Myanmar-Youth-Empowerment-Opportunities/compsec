# Defence

Defence in computer security is performed mostly by minimising the attack surface.

1. build a threat model, so that you are aware of what kind of attacker(s) you are likely to face
2. be aware of what kind of attacks may be possible against your system
3. work to close down those attacks (i.e. "reduce attack surface")

You may notice that this is a very re-active approach. That is true, but it mostly works, and there are not many other options available.

Once you build up a big enough list of possible attacks, and shut down all those approaches, then there are no approaches left for an attacker.

Occasionally, someone will come up with a totally new form of attack which hasn't been tried before, and you will have to re-evaluate. But, more commonly,
you will simply fail to properly account for an existing class of attack.

Because this form of defence requires building a list of attacks, it explains why we might mostly study attack before defence in this guide.
Because not every layman wants to learn cyber security in detail, it explains why "how to have good cybersecurity" guides, often take the form of super boring and long lists of "rules" that you have to follow -- those guides are jumping straight to step 3 -- shut down attacks, while skipping the "understand the problem" steps.
Those type of guides are better than nothing for begginners, but they are not ideal.

The alternative approach is called "proactive defence", and it might include things like actively hunting down attackers before they even attack you, or having systems in place to detect attackers, and launch counter attacks.
In general this does not work very well. In cybersecurity defence, not attack, is the best form of defence. Reasons that proactive defence doesn't work very well include:

- there are too many possible attackers in the world, we cannot hunt all of them
- if we develop good attacks, our attackers may steal them (this famously happened to the NSA, when china and russia stole their attack tools)
- attacks can be done very quickly, so, by the team we detect an attack, we might alreayd have been destroyed
- every amount of time we spend on proactive defence is less time we can spend on reducing the attack surface
